# Monsters Rolodex

This is a very simple React app that gets some dummy user data from an API, transforming that data into a searchable rolodex of monsters.

This was a part of the Zero to Mastery React course, and was a guided tutorial to learn some of the basics of React. I've used React before, but am using the course to have more of a detailed knowledge about the framework.

I used GitHub pages to deploy the app here: https://ehwus.github.io/monsters-rolodex/
